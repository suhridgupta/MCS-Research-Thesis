I wish to thank my primary supervisor, Dr. Tawfiq Islam for his generous and invaluable support, feedback, patience, and guidance throughout the whole research process. His continuous encouragement and insights, both personal and professional, has made an immeasurably impact on me throughout my two semesters working under his supervision. I further wish to thank my co-supervisor Prof. Rajkumar Buyya. His guidance in helping me to set up milestones as well as reviewing my research experiments and thesis ensured I met my research deadlines in a timely manner. I am grateful to have had them both as my supervisors, and this research thesis would not have been possible without their support.\par

I further wish to thank my friends and family for their selfless and constant help throughout my time here at The University of Melbourne, for always motivating me, and for their endless guidance which has helped me complete this research project.\par
